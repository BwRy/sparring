# This script is part of sparring.
# It can be used to set up network and operating system parameters needed for
# analysis of traffic with sparring in TRANSPARENT mode.
# 
# Assumptions made:
# 1) Analysis takes place in virtualised guests
# 2) The maximum number of guests is known. $TAPS will not be set lower
# 3) The physical interface will shortly be unavailable during invocation of
# this script for acquiring a DHCP-assigned IP address
# 4) Note that 3) implies that the physical host gets configured by DHCP!
# 5) Guests should be configured with static IP addresses as this allows for
# better correlating them during the analysis (and chosing the right -a
# parameter of sparring)
# 6) host services like SSH.. should be bound to 0.0.0.0 or the _bridge's_ IP
# 7) After analysis, the physical interface is advised to reclaim a
# DHCP-assigned IP address
#
# For now, this script assumes, that an analysis of virtualised hosts is done.
# Therefore it takes care to isolate these from each other. Different
# scenarios where local traffic has to be dissected, are also supported, the
# corresponding rules in ipt_rules() have to be enabled in this case.

# The following variables can be tuned for different environments. At present
# there are no cmdline switches to set them as using local variables keeps the
# invocation of this script rather simple.
#
# physical interface used for host-external connectivity
