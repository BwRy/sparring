Installation
============================

Make sure all requirements listed below are met. Exceptions can be made for
unused application modules, i.e. if you do not plan to use the IRC module, you
won't need the twisted framework either.

Move the sparring folder to a location of your choice.

Requirements
============================

Linux kernel >=2.6.14

IP Userspace queueing via NETLINK (symbol IP_NF_QUEUE) must  *NOT* be enabled!
"NFQUEUE" target Support (symbol NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_NFQUEUE) kernel support

  │     -> Networking support (NET [=y])
  │       -> Networking options
  │         -> Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter) (NETFILTER [=y])
  │           -> Core Netfilter Configuration
  │             -> Netfilter Xtables support (required for ip_tables) (NETFILTER_XTABLES [=y])     
  │   Depends on: NET [=y] && INET [=y] && NETFILTER [=y] && NETFILTER_XTABLES [=y] && NETFILTER_ADVANCED [=y]

IP: policy routing
  │     -> Networking support (NET [=y])
  |        -> Networking options
  |           -> TCP/IP networking (INET [=y])
  |              -> IP: advanced router (IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER [=y])


TPROXY + TPROXY Target support in kernel, NF_CONNTRACK
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_SOCKET Socket match support
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_MARK  mark target support
ebtables (BROUTING, redirect)

iptables, ebtables and bridge-utils userland programs

python (tested: 2.7)
python-nfqueue (runtime: libnetfilter-queue, build-time: libnetfilter-queue, swig, cmake)
dpkt (ip)
webob (http module)
twisted (irc module)
dnslib (dns module)

NO python modules providing a class named irc may be installed (for example
python-irc)!

Deployment
============================

You can put sparring anywhere you like. You also may want to link sparring.py
to e.g. /usr/bin for your covenience.


Usage
============================

You have to specify the IP address that sparring is supposed to interpret as
its own outgoing (read: towards the internet) address on startup. This is done
by using the mandatory -a switch.
 
sparring can operate in three modes:

 - TRANSPARENT
   all traffic is passed to its original destination, logging and parsing of
   known is done.

 - HALF
   like transparent mode but modules can alter, block or redirect traffic

 - FULL
   like transparent mode but no communication is passed to the rest of the
   world, rather it's handled entirely by sparring


On termination (SIGTERM,...) sparring will print default statistics in text form.


Development
============================

New applications and transports may use the provided base classes to extend
sparring's functionality.

Please note that webob, dpkg and twisted had to be (monkey) patched to work
properly (with sparring). See utils/ for more details.
