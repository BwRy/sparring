  integrate as auxiliary module
  open problem: sparring needs root permissions at least for nfqueue-related operations

replace inet_{ntoa,aton} [with htons]

handle_{half,full}
  recheck cStringIO-objects for needed .seek(n) before access (at least in irc.py)

http.py:
  fix POST (again) (at least for half mode)

transport/*:
  connection recognition is done by the local ip:port-pair.
  this is suboptimal due to the fact that ports *will* be reused after some
  time so bad things will happen in this case (stats overwritten/mixed up)

transport/*: catch key error in case of spurious packets (or wrongly set
-a parameter) example:
