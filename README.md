sparring
========

Network simulation for malware analysis.
`sparring` is supposed to assist with the analysis of network traffic
generated by possibly malicious software. This is achieved by automating the
logging of known protocols and extracting sent or received payloads where
applicable. Support for integration with the automated malware analysis
framework cuckoo (<http://cuckoosandbox.org>) is on its way.

Network setup
=============

`sparring` can be run in three different modes of operation.
They are:

 * __full mode__  
  No communication may leave the analysing host. Supported and activated
  protocols are processed by sparring.
 * __half mode__  
  Data sent by the (malware) sample is intercepted, possibly modified and
  either passed to its destination host or discarded.
 * __transparent mode__  
  While working transparently, sparring will not alter any transmitted data
  and only log connections and try to extract interesting data for supported
  protocols.
